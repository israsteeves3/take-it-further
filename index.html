    <h1> Introduction to Podcasting</h1>
    <p>A podcast is an episodic series of spoken-word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening. Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient and integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices. A podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to completely improvised.</p>
    <p>The cost to the consumer is low, with many podcasts free to download. Some are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale. Because podcast content is often free, podcasting is often classified as a disruptive medium, adverse to the maintenance of traditional revenue models. </p>
    <p>The name podcast comes from the iPodâ„¢ which was one of the most popular early portable <abbr title="Moving Pictures Experts Group Layer-3 Audio">MP3</abbr> players. Most podcasts still release their episodes as MP3 files to this day. </p>
<h2>The Gear You Need</h2>
    <p> <i>Contrary to popular belief, podcast doesn't have to be expensive.</i> Starting your own podcast is less complicated or technically demanding than you may think. You only need a few things:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A microphone</li>
            <li>Audio recording software such as Garage Band or Audacit</li>
         <li>Audio conferencing technology (Zoom, Skype, etc) if you wish to have a guest or co-host</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Some computers have a built in microphone, but you may find the quality isn't as good as you'd like. You can purchase an affordable <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> microphone at your local electronics store, or online for less than $40.</p>
